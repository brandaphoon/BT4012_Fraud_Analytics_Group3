# BT4012 Fraud Analytics Group Project - Vehicle Insurance Claim Fraud Detection

**NUS AY2022/23, Semester 1 (School Project)**

**By: Project Group 3**

## Project Task Description
We are tasked to apply relevant fraud analysis and machine learning techniques that we have acquired through the course to build a fraud detection process to solve a real-world problem. 


## Project Background & Description
For this project, our group have decided to focus on Vehicle Insurance (Auto Insurance) Claim Fraud Detection. Claim Fraud happens when individuals make false or invalid claims involving personal injuries or property damage after getting into an accident. Fraudulent claims happen when fraudsters 
1. “Arrange” for accidents (staged accidents)
2. Make exaggerated personal injury claims
3. Fake identities to claim they have serious damages 
4. Etc

Statistics have also shown that auto insurance frauds currently is estimated to have caused $29 billion of US dollars of damages to auto insurers annually. Hence, it draws our interest and motivation to look into this area, and we hope that through machine learning techniques, fraudulent claims in this industry can be combatted better and the time used for fraud detection can be reduced. 

Therefore, this project aims to identify the different machine learning models that would be crucial for vehicle insurance claim fraud detection. 


## Data Information
The dataset used for this project is a dataset that’s obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/vehicle-claim-fraud-detection). It’s a real dataset from an American insurance company that contains 15420 observations and 33 variables in total, with **FraudFound_P** be our target variable for the classification of vehicle insurance claims.
